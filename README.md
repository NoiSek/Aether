## Requirements
- [lightdm-webkit2-greeter (aur/lightdm-webkit2-greeter )](https://github.com/Antergos/lightdm-webkit2-greeter)

## Installation

**Recommended Automatic Installation**

[Available on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lightdm-webkit-theme-aether/). ArchLinux users can substitute pacaur with yaourt, packer, etc. as necessary and install with the following:

```
pacaur -S lightdm-webkit-theme-aether
```

**Manual Installation**

This assumes that you already have lightdm and lightdm-webkit2-greeter installed (but not configured).

NOTE: Users performing a manual installation directly from Github should replace the `lightdm-webkit-theme-aether` values in the provided sed commands with `Aether` to match the name of the theme directory. Users performing a manual installation from the AUR should make no changes.

```
# If you prefer the last stable release, download from the releases page instead: https://github.com/NoiSek/Aether/releases/latest
git clone git@github.com:NoiSek/Aether.git
sudo cp --recursive Aether /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/lightdm-webkit-theme-aether

# Set default lightdm-webkit2-greeter theme to Aether
sudo sed -i 's/^webkit_theme\s*=\s*\(.*\)/webkit_theme = lightdm-webkit-theme-aether #\1/g' /etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit2-greeter.conf

# Set default lightdm greeter to lightdm-webkit2-greeter
sudo sed -i 's/^\(#?greeter\)-session\s*=\s*\(.*\)/greeter-session = lightdm-webkit2-greeter #\1/ #\2g' /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
```


### **Accessing the Settings Dialogue**

Hover over the bottom left of your screen to find the settings button. Once active, theme settings will remain open in a draggable dialogue window until dismissed.


### **Setting an Avatar Image**

![](./src/img/default-user.png)

Once LightDM, LightDM Webkit Greeter, and Aether are installed you will need to set an avatar image for your users. Size is irrelevant, and avatars will be displayed as a 125x125 circle (Yes, square images too). Users that don't have an avatar set will default to the [astronaut](./src/img/default-user.png).

To accomplish this, you can do either of the following:
- Create an image in your home directory named `.face`.
- Append `Icon=/path/to/your/avatar.png` to the bottom of the file at `/var/lib/AccountsService/users/<youraccountname>`

### **Using Your Own Wallpapers**

#### Method One:
Add and delete wallpapers within the `src/img/wallpapers/` directory as you see fit. By default, you will find this folder at the absolute path: `/usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/lightdm-webkit-theme-aether/src/img/wallpapers/`.

#### Method Two:
Edit the `background_images` value under `branding` within your lightdm-webkit config file located at `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit2-greeter.conf`.
*Note: This ignores the default value of /usr/share/backgrounds, as this is always set and would prevent the default wallpapers from working. To use wallpapers from within that directory, create a subdirectory at /usr/share/backgrounds/aether (or any other folder name) and change your config value accordingly.*

### **Modifying Date and Time Format**

The formatting symbols are not necessarily what you would expect them to be! See the following:

## Troubleshooting

### My login screen hasn't changed!

Make sure you have lightdm enabled via systemctl with `systemctl is-enabled lightdm.service`. If it isn't, follow up with:
```
sudo systemctl enable lightdm.service
```

### My screen is black!

Verify that your libgl / glx drivers are properly installed. Find any potential issues with your X config by switching to another TTY with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and trying:
```
sudo cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i "glx"
```

Are you able to run `glxinfo` without errors?

### My system hangs at the boot screen!

Switch to another TTY with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and check your lightdm logs by running:
```
sudo tail /var/log/lightdm/seat0-greeter.log
```

If you see something similar to:
```
*** (lightdm:709): CRITICAL **: session_get_login1_session_id: assertion 'session != NULL' failed
```

Then you should try re-installing and / or reconfiguring your graphics drivers, especially if this occurred after a kernel update.

### The lock screen isn't using my lightdm theme!

If you are using cinnamon, gnome, or any gnome derivative; Good Luck. The solution involves [light-locker (community/light-locker)](https://github.com/the-cavalry/light-locker), but conflicts with the existing lock / screensaver applications. There is no known way to resolve this.

If you are not using a gnome derivative, see below.

Solution:

```
echo "light-locker &" >> ~/.xprofile
```

## Development

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

- `npm install` *(While in project directory)*

### Running Tests
```
npm run test
```

### Building Project
```
npm run build
```

### Monitoring Changes
```
npm run watch
```
